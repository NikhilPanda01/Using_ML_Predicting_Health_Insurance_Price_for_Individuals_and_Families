# Project Title: Predicting Health Insurance Price for Individuals and Families

## Introduction

**Background:**
In today's world, health insurance is a crucial component of financial planning and well-being. However, determining the actual health insurance cost for an individual or a family can be a complex task influenced by various factors such as age, family size, and underlying health conditions. To address this challenge, our project aims to provide a data-driven solution for estimating health insurance costs.

**Project Objective:**
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast health insurance costs for prospective customers. To achieve this, we have partnered with an insurance company that has already gathered a substantial dataset, containing the necessary information for data analysis and machine learning tasks.

**The Challenge:**
Health insurance costs are not set in stone and can vary significantly from one person or family to another. To arrive at a fair and personalized insurance premium, it's crucial to consider a wide range of variables, including demographic factors, lifestyle choices, and medical history. Traditional methods have often been imprecise in estimating these costs, which is where data science and machine learning can make a significant impact.

**Our Role:**
As data scientists, our responsibility is to delve into the insurance company's dataset, perform comprehensive data analysis, and ultimately construct a robust machine-learning model. This model will leverage the collected data to predict health insurance costs with a high degree of accuracy. By doing so, we aim to assist our client in offering fair and competitive insurance premiums to their prospective clients.

## Project Phases

**Phase 1: Data Exploration**
- Commencing with a comprehensive examination of the dataset, our primary task is to acquire an in-depth comprehension of the variables and identify potential patterns and correlations.

**Phase 2: Data Preprocessing**
- To render the data amenable to machine learning, we will embark on data cleaning, transformation, and normalization. This encompasses addressing missing data, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing numerical features.

**Phase 3: Feature Selection**
- We will undertake the judicious selection of pertinent features that significantly contribute to precise predictions while eliminating extraneous noise.

**Phase 4: Model Development**
- Leveraging a spectrum of machine learning algorithms, we will engage in the construction of predictive models, fine-tuning them to achieve optimal performance.

**Phase 5: Model Evaluation**
- The models developed will undergo rigorous assessment using pertinent metrics, such as mean absolute error or root mean squared error, to gauge their effectiveness in predicting health insurance costs.

**Phase 6: Deployment**
- Upon achieving a high-performing model, our focus will shift toward deployment, ensuring that it can be effectively utilized for real-time cost predictions for prospective clients.

## Variables in the Dataset

- **age**: Age of the primary beneficiary.
- **sex**: Gender of the insurance contractor (female, male).
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index, providing insight into body weight relative to height.
- **children**: Number of children covered by health insurance (dependents).
- **smoker**: Smoking status (smoker or non-smoker).
- **region**: The beneficiary's residential area in the US (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest).
- **charges**: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance.

## Conclusion :

Final Model:
- Train Accuracy: 0.8928411362907434
- Test accuracy: 0.8356617680571132
- CV Score: 0.8652659436933987

- The XGBoost model has demonstrated the highest level of accuracy among all the models, indicating that its predictions closely align with the actual values when compared to other models.

- Despite using a relatively small dataset, the insights we've gained from these models mirror real-life observations. With a larger dataset, we could uncover even more intricate patterns that reveal the complex relationship between independent features and the premiums charged to buyers.

In this project, we touched at pretty much the main processes of carrying an end-to-end Machine learning project, which are:

- Exploratory data analysis
- Data preparation
- Training the model
- Model selection
- Testing the model



I also want to mention some of the limitations of this project and what could be improved:

- We could do a chi-square test.
- We could also retrain the model without the least predictive features.
- We could also do some more feature engineering and feature scaling to get better Accuracy.
- This is my first machine-learning project with a large dataset. Though I'm currently familiar with a few models, I'm open to considering additional models, including neural networks and other regression techniques.
